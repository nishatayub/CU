# 🆓 FREE AI Integration Guide

## 💰 No Money Required! 

Your CodeUnity app now works with **completely free AI alternatives**! Here are your options:

## 🎯 Option 1: Pattern-Based AI (Already Working!)

**Cost:** $0 forever
**Setup:** None required - it's already working!
**Features:**
- Basic code analysis
- Simple debugging suggestions  
- Code pattern recognition
- Language detection

**Try it now:** Go to your app and use the Copilot panel - it will work immediately with free pattern-based analysis!

## 🚀 Option 2: Ollama - Free Local AI (Recommended)

**Cost:** $0 forever
**Quality:** Much better than pattern matching
**Setup:** 5 minutes

### Quick Setup:
```bash
# Install Ollama (free)
brew install ollama

# Download a free coding model (3.8GB)
ollama run codellama

# That's it! Your app will automatically detect and use it
```

**Models you can use for free:**
- `codellama` - Meta's coding AI (3.8GB)
- `deepseek-coder` - Excellent for code (6GB) 
- `codegemma` - Google's coding AI (5GB)

## 🌐 Option 3: Upgrade to OpenAI (If You Want Premium)

**Cost:** ~$5-10/month for typical usage
**Quality:** Best possible
**Setup:** Get API key from OpenAI

## 🔧 How It Works

Your app **automatically detects** what's available:

1. ✅ **OpenAI API key found** → Uses premium OpenAI
2. ✅ **Ollama running** → Uses free local AI  
3. ✅ **Nothing else** → Uses free pattern analysis
